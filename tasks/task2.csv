Further information would have to be known to properly make this decision, but for now i wrote it as news since there was an image attached and it did show barricades around the building, but it could potentially be an opinion of there are no official sources to confirm the fact at the time"
1.54034E+18,yes,opinion/news but more opinonated than news ,breaking news event is part of the tweet - the overturning of roe v wade ,,this is a pro life stance since the tweet advocates saving children from abortion,," The tweet contains a mix of news and opinion.The statement about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade can be seen as news if it is accurate, while the rest of the tweet expresses a pro-life opinion and emphasizes Texas as a pro-life state. I said its misinformation because they claim that texas is a pro life state, and that view is subjective, so objectively speaking this is misiformation because its not factual. "

1.52233E+18,yes ,opinion,,,,the text seem very pro choice and seems that it is geared to make you think that the lady who is answering the question states that biden is pro life; so it seems that someone who is pro choice wanted it to seem that biden is pro life,"the video of the lady is very different from what was stated on the tweet, hence I classififed this as misinformation.
