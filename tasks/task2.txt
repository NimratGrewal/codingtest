So, the process that i figured for classifying the categories was a bit different since i actually manually found the tweets. 

For the misinformation category, i labelled it as misinformation if the tweet contradicted what we know as common information and/or
it may be giving us information that is news that is not confirmed by official sources.

for the category, i labelled it as news if the main point of the tweet was to display news, and labelled it an opinion if 
the main point of the tweet was to display an opinion - this includes beliefs or 'facts' that people may claim that may have 
no official sources behind it. There were some tweets that were a mix of both - that displayed news and an opinion 
and those i labelled as 'news or opinion if...' where it could be counted as an opinion if official sources did not confirm this 
to be the case, but that there is also a news aspect to it, and they both seem pretty equally balanced, so we don't know which 
one the tweeter wanted to have more emphasis on. 

I labelled something as breaking news if it was urgent and time sensitive (new) and the undertone behind it seemed like it was 
new news. I labelled something as normal news if the tweet did not display the same urgency, and may perhaps had been looking to 
add to the facts of the news that we know previously.

For pro life and pro choice, if someone was advocating for either, and it was an stronger opionated standpoint, then i just lablled it as that, but 
if it was potential news or a mix of a news and opinion, then i also looked at misinformation to see if this information was accurate,
and also looked at the context behind the tweet as well to see which one it was leaning more towards if any. 

Overall, i looked at misinformation for all the tweets to see how trustworthy the tweet context was in terms of all the categories.
